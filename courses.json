In detail we look at the hierarchical structure of logical language, the role of facts and facts, and Wittgenstein's famous sentence 7 on the unspeakable. We critically analyse his theories on logic and ethics, and how they influenced the philosophy of the 20th century.

The course addresses a pressing issue in neuroscience and psychology: the accumulation of vast data sets without adequate time or resources for their integration into scientific theories. To tackle this, the course explores how other scientific fields have successfully incorporated artificial intelligence into their research processes. The course combines lectures with practical programming exercises, enabling participants to learn about and apply automated discovery techniques from physics and machine learning. These techniques will be used to develop models explaining human behavior and brain function. This course lays the groundwork for advanced study and research in the emerging field of automated scientific discovery.\n\nCourse Structure:\nThe block course consists of four blocks. Each block will contain a lecture introducing a topic of automated scientific discovery, followed by hands-on programming exercises in which students get to implement automated discovery techniques and apply them to real-world data sets. Students will also familiarize themselves with professional software development techniques, such as unit tests and code reviews. All programming exercises will be conducted in Python and facilitated through GitHub.

We will read and discuss texts on topics such as oppression, bias, and racism. Moreover, we will explore the concept of intersectionality which may help to understand specific instances of discrimination. In a second step, the seminar focusses on relating the previously discussed theories and concepts to the domain of Artificial Intelligence. Looking at different examples of discrimination by Artificial Intelligence systems (e.g. through chatbots or face recognition), we will discuss why they may be especially prone to discriminatory practices. .

Investigating various phenomena ranging from addictive interface design of social media, and targeted advertising to AI Beauty Filters, in our previous work we have organized school lessons at high schools, facilitated workshops for various audiences, designed games and websites and curated an event at Kunsthalle Osnabr\u00fcck.\n\nStarting this summer term, our study project will pursue a new focus area. Introducing \"Predicted Futures?\" as our new topic, we will investigate how big-data-driven technologies are shaping \u2013 and perhaps predetermining \u2013 the future.  \n\nThe following questions will guide us on this investigation: How are big-data-driven technologies applied to predict our behaviour, interests, emotions, desires or health? In which way do they actually path the way into a predetermined future, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy? What are the politics behind the urge and the application of predictive analytics that make it seem as an acceptable way of solving the polycrises of today? And how are common narratives of tech-determinism and tech-solutionism prefiguring our understanding of possible futures? What could alternative, inclusive and sustainable futures look like? And what role would AI play in it?\n\nWe are excited to embark on this journey in collaboration with Theater Osnabr\u00fcck, Kunsthalle Osnabr\u00fcck, Museum f\u00fcr Industriekultur and various regional schools. As a cornerstone of the project, we aim to encourage an intergenerational dialogue on desirable tech-futures. Based on the theater play \"(R)Evolution\" we will work with high-school students and engage them into a conversation about the realities of AI and their visions for the future.\n\nParticipation opportunities\nWe are inviting both Study project (2 Semesters, 12 ECTS each), as well as Interdisciplinary course (1 Semester, 6 ECTS) participants to join us. Interdisciplinary participants will work on a project of smaller scope. There will be two focus areas:\n\nA) Workshop Track (7\u20138 students in total)\nIn groups of 2\u20133 students you are conceptualizing, developing and testing a workshop for high school students on the basis of the theater play. You will document your findings during the workshop and create an Open Educational Resource (OER) for further circulation. Depending on availabilities your group might also organize workshops at the Museum of Industriekultur, which is hosting an exhibition on AI this summer. \nGerman fluency necessary!\n\nB) Research Track (3\u20134 students in total)\nYou accompany the workshops and, on the basis of participatory observation, record the results of the vision-finding processes. Based on these findings, you are preparing an academic paper. Possible areas of focus:\nA) Investigate younger generations' perspectives on the challenges of technological and socio-ecological change and how they can be made more visible and audible in the public discourse in a constructive way. \nB) Reflect the methodology of the visioning work with students and formulate qualitative findings on the intergenerational dialog on AI futures.\nGerman fluency is an advantage.\n\nParticipation requirements\n- Prior knowledge in the field of data ethics. Ideally, completion of the lecture \"Intro to Ethics of AI\" or similar lectures/seminars. (See the preregistration form for more info).\n- On site participation, Tuesdays 2\u20135 pm\n- Due to the close collaboration with local cultural institutions this semester, sufficient German skills (~B2) are necessary. However, we would make an exception for up to 3 students who would work on a research-focused project.\n\nIf you are interested in joining us, please fill out this form until March 26th, noon:  https://cloud.ethikderki.de/index.php/apps/forms/s/nzC7G45M9d58qbQYJTib6qHj\n\nA second round of preregistration might be opened later, depending on availabilities.\n\nWe are looking forward to your responses and an insightful next semester!

And what role would Artificial Intelligence play in it?\n\nWe are excited to embark on this journey in collaboration with Theater Osnabr\u00fcck, Kunsthalle Osnabr\u00fcck, Museum f\u00fcr Industriekultur and various regional schools. As a cornerstone of the project, we aim to encourage an intergenerational dialogue on desirable tech-futures. Based on the theater play \"(R)Evolution\" we will work with high-school students and engage them into a conversation about the realities of Artificial Intelligence and their visions for the future.\n\nParticipation opportunities\nWe are inviting both Study project (2 Semesters, 12 ECTS each), as well as Interdisciplinary course (1 Semester, 6 ECTS) participants to join us. Interdisciplinary participants will work on a project of smaller scope. There will be two focus areas:\n\nA) Workshop Track (7\u20138 students in total)\nIn groups of 2\u20133 students you are conceptualizing, developing and testing a workshop for high school students on the basis of the theater play. You will document your findings during the workshop and create an Open Educational Resource (OER) for further circulation. Depending on availabilities your group might also organize workshops at the Museum of Industriekultur, which is hosting an exhibition on Artificial Intelligence this summer. \nGerman fluency necessary!\n\nB) Research Track (3\u20134 students in total)\nYou accompany the workshops and, on the basis of participatory observation, record the results of the vision-finding processes. Based on these findings, you are preparing an academic paper. Possible areas of focus:\nA) Investigate younger generations' perspectives on the challenges of technological and socio-ecological change and how they can be made more visible and audible in the public discourse in a constructive way. \nB) Reflect the methodology of the visioning work with students and formulate qualitative findings on the intergenerational dialog on Artificial Intelligence futures.\nGerman fluency is an advantage.\n\nParticipation requirements\n- Prior knowledge in the field of data ethics. Ideally, completion of the lecture \"Introduction to Ethics of Artificial Intelligence\" or similar lectures/seminars. (See the preregistration form for more info).\n- On site participation, Tuesdays 2\u20135 pm\n- Due to the close collaboration with local cultural institutions this semester, sufficient German skills (~B2) are necessary. However, we would make an exception for up to 3 students who would work on a research-focused project.\n\nIf you are interested in joining us, please fill out this form until March 26th, noon:  https://cloud.ethikderki.de/index.php/apps/forms/s/nzC7G45M9d58qbQYJTib6qHj\n\nA second round of preregistration might be opened later, depending on availabilities.\n\nWe are looking forward to your responses and an insightful next semester! .

It is open to all interested students of all levels, including those from the humanities, as well as scientific and technical disciplines. \n\nThe lecture is an ideal starting point to get an orientation in the field and to possibly start engaging with more specialized courses and/or research projects in the context of the Ethics and Critical Theories of AI group at the IKW.\nThe lecture will provide an overview of problems, philosophical theories and methods that comprise the field(s) of Ethics and Critical Theories of AI. This includes both the philosophical foundations of ethics, critical theory and some aspects of social philosophy (such as power) as well as different technological phenomena and legal aspects of AI. A particular focus will be contemporary data-driven and machine learning-based AI technology and its applications in digital consumer media. As we will see, questions of social equality and fairness are central to today's ethical concerns about AI, so that ethics needs to adopt a societal perspective, analyzing constellations of power, subjectivation, discrimination and subordination that relate to AI technology. Ethics will be framed in relation to intersectional critical philosophy, feminist and post-colonial theories. We will also touch upon relevant legal debates such as privacy and data protection legislation and AI regulation.\n\nThe lecture is hybrid and will be available in three formats: On site in the lecture hall; live stream on BBB; and asynchronous participation via video recordings. Discussion groups will be either in person or online.\n\nNotice that for this lecture there are separate discussion groups (\u00dcbung) to which you have to subscribe separately.

This is where consciousness comes into play. Furthermore, Goff believes that his account provides the basis for a solution to the problem of fine tuning - an account of why the natural constants in the Universe are the way they are - that opens up a middle ground between theism and multiverse theory and allows for a form of moral realism.

            "description": "In the early 1980s, the neuroscientist Benjamin Libet decided to make the philosophical claim that people have free will empirically testable. He instructed subjects to freely decide within the next minute or so to make a simple voluntary motor movement, like flexing their hand. He measured the exact time of the onset of muscular acitivity in order to determine the time of the movement (M). He also invented an ingenious device in order to measure the exact time when people first became consciously aware of their decision to execute the movement (W). Lastly, he used EEG to record the exact time of the onset of the Readiness Potential, a neural activity that precedes motor movements (RP). \n\nThe findings of Libet's experiments were as follows: RP preceeded M by about 550MS. That is, it apparently takes the brain about half a second to initiate a simple motor movement. However, W preceeded M by about only 200MS. W (the 'conscious will') thus occured only about a third of a second AFTER the brain had already begun to initiate the movement! For that reason, Libet's experiments and others along similar lines have ever since been said to show that \"Free Will is an Illusion\", that the conscious will simply comes too late for it to have any impact on what we do. \n\nThis, of course, has sparked some controversy. Part of the controversy is philosophical. Philosophers have, for example, questioned whether Libet's notion of free will is viable, whether it is the kind of free will worth caring about. Interestingly, however, part of the controversy is also empirical. There are lots and lots of methodological problems with Libet-style experiments that do not throw doubt on the philosophical interpretation of Libet's results, but on the viability of the results themselves.

            "description": "Episodic cognition comprises episodic memory and episodic future thinking. (The term \u201cepisodic memory\u201d is much more known than the other terms, \u201cepisodic future thinking\u201d or \u201cepisodic cognition\u201d.) If episodic memory is the memory of daily personal experiences (\u201cthings that happened to me yesterday, or 10 years ago\u201d), then episodic future thinking is the prospection of things that may happen to me tomorrow or in 10 years. Importantly, episodes (past or future) carry www information: what, where and when. That is, the content of our memory (what happened) is remembered in its spatio-temporal context (where, when). That\u2019s why this kind of memory is also called \u201crelational\u201d memory. The same holds for episodic future thinking: I am imagining myself experiencing something at a certain place and time. How do I do this? By mental time travel, i.e., I project myself into my personal past or future. Mental time travel is characterized by chronesthesia \u2013 a sense of time and autonoesis \u2013 a sense of self: knowing that this has happened/will happen to me.\nIn this course, we will discuss various aspects of episodic cognition:\nHow episodic memory differs from semantic memory and from autobiographic memory in the memory taxonomy.\nHow philosophers conceive of episodic cognition: Is it a \u201cnatural kind\u201d? \u2013 as compared to other forms of memory, in particular when we consider its sequential character. What does it \u201cfeel like\u201d to have an episodic memory, how do these past (or future) episodes appear to us (phenomenologically)?\nWhich (distinct) brain areas support episodic memory and future thinking? Prime candidates are the hippocampus with its place and time cells and the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL).\nHow does episodic cognition develop in children? Endel Tulving (who is a big figure in episodic memory research) claimed that children under 4 years of age do not have episodic memory at all! Now we know that episodic memory develops heavily between 3-5 years of age (and episodic future thinking a bit later). We also have an idea which cognitive abilities support it (executive function, language).\nWhen we think of a past or envision a future episode we often detach our eye-gaze from the objects around us or our interlocutor and look into the void (e.g., we stare at the ceiling or into the sky). Do such \u201cnon-visual eye-movements\u201d tell us anything about episodic cognition? Do we construct our episodes mentally while we are seemingly \u201clooking at nothing\u201d?\nDo non-human animals have episodic cognition? For a long time this was not held possible (mainly because they cannot tell you!). Animals were thought to be \u201cstuck in time\u201d, i.e., not capable of mental time travel. However, with appropriate methodology and concepts we nowadays grant \u201cepisodic-like\u201d memory and future thinking to them. Interestingly, also animals in whom you would not suspect it have quite remarkable episodic cognitive abilities, e.g. jays (big-brained birds.)\nLastly, can you also conceive of things in the past that could have been? Certainly, but do such \u201cepisodic counter-factuals\u201d resemble true episodic memories in terms of the cognitive processes and brain areas supporting them?\nEpisodic cognition is obviously highly relevant for us humans, in our daily life and at an existential level: Who would we be without our personal memories and our envisioned future? In our seminar, we will discuss these (and more) questions concerning episodic cognition, in an interdisciplinary cognitive science perspective. ",

            "soup": "Title: Episodic Cognition. Description: Episodic cognition comprises episodic memory and episodic future thinking. (The term \u201cepisodic memory\u201d is much more known than the other terms, \u201cepisodic future thinking\u201d or \u201cepisodic cognition\u201d.) If episodic memory is the memory of daily personal experiences (\u201cthings that happened to me yesterday, or 10 years ago\u201d), then episodic future thinking is the prospection of things that may happen to me tomorrow or in 10 years. Importantly, episodes (past or future) carry www information: what, where and when. That is, the content of our memory (what happened) is remembered in its spatio-temporal context (where, when). That\u2019s why this kind of memory is also called \u201crelational\u201d memory. The same holds for episodic future thinking: I am imagining myself experiencing something at a certain place and time. How do I do this? By mental time travel, i.e., I project myself into my personal past or future. Mental time travel is characterized by chronesthesia \u2013 a sense of time and autonoesis \u2013 a sense of self: knowing that this has happened/will happen to me.\nIn this course, we will discuss various aspects of episodic cognition:\nHow episodic memory differs from semantic memory and from autobiographic memory in the memory taxonomy.\nHow philosophers conceive of episodic cognition: Is it a \u201cnatural kind\u201d? \u2013 as compared to other forms of memory, in particular when we consider its sequential character. What does it \u201cfeel like\u201d to have an episodic memory, how do these past (or future) episodes appear to us (phenomenologically)?\nWhich (distinct) brain areas support episodic memory and future thinking? Prime candidates are the hippocampus with its place and time cells and the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL).\nHow does episodic cognition develop in children? Endel Tulving (who is a big figure in episodic memory research) claimed that children under 4 years of age do not have episodic memory at all! Now we know that episodic memory develops heavily between 3-5 years of age (and episodic future thinking a bit later). We also have an idea which cognitive abilities support it (executive function, language).\nWhen we think of a past or envision a future episode we often detach our eye-gaze from the objects around us or our interlocutor and look into the void (e.g., we stare at the ceiling or into the sky). Do such \u201cnon-visual eye-movements\u201d tell us anything about episodic cognition? Do we construct our episodes mentally while we are seemingly \u201clooking at nothing\u201d?\nDo non-human animals have episodic cognition? For a long time this was not held possible (mainly because they cannot tell you!). Animals were thought to be \u201cstuck in time\u201d, i.e., not capable of mental time travel. However, with appropriate methodology and concepts we nowadays grant \u201cepisodic-like\u201d memory and future thinking to them. Interestingly, also animals in whom you would not suspect it have quite remarkable episodic cognitive abilities, e.g. jays (big-brained birds.)\nLastly, can you also conceive of things in the past that could have been? Certainly, but do such \u201cepisodic counter-factuals\u201d resemble true episodic memories in terms of the cognitive processes and brain areas supporting them?\nEpisodic cognition is obviously highly relevant for us humans, in our daily life and at an existential level: Who would we be without our personal memories and our envisioned future? In our seminar, we will discuss these (and more) questions concerning episodic cognition, in an interdisciplinary cognitive science perspective. . Status: Seminar. Mode: not specified. ECTS: 6.

Through exploring neurocognitive and comparative experimental research, we will examine the underlying mechanisms in the human mind and brain that govern language processing, usage, and evolution. The course will emphasize linguistic pragmatics, a sub-discipline that studies language as a communication tool in social contexts, drawing on foundational concepts from analytical philosophy and linguistic pragmatic models and linking this to language evolution theories.

The evident value of such a system for purposes ranging from musical education, preservation, performance, and distribution, along with the inherent commercial appeal tied to its utility, has ignited both academic and commercial interest.\n\nWith recent advances in sequence-to-sequence learning techniques that in a good part may be attributed to the development of transformer networks, the creation of a complete AMT system appears more feasible than ever since the inception of the field.  A successful example of\ngeneral-purpose AMT with the help of transformers has already been reported on by Gardner et al. (2022) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03017]. However, the field still offers many unexplored avenues which bare the potential for impactful research, easily accommodated under the umbrella of Cognitive Science.\n\nTo participate in this project, some basic knowledge in deep learning is recommended.  People with a background in music theory or audio processing, but also deep learners who want to focus on sequence-to-sequence learning and transformers may find this project specifically interesting. .

However, it still learns fast and efficient. But how is this possible? A sufficient part of learning in the brain is implemented as local changes in connections between neurons. We call this synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity as a learning mechanism is commonly used in spiking neural networks (SNNs) \u2013 a class of neural networks similar to the real brain.\n\nIn this seminar, we will work with synaptic plasticity in SNNs. We will learn about biologically-plausible learning mechanisms for spiking networks, such as: STDP, reward-modulated STDP, BCM, intrinsic plasticity, homeostatic plasticity, etc. We will engage in programming of spiking neural networks in Python, with the focus on these and similar learning mechanisms. \n\nThe seminar is aimed at master and higher semester bachelor students who are interested to know how the brain learns, and how to model it.

Description: Neurons in the brain learn differently from neurons in artificial neural networks (ANNs): there is arguably no gradient-based learning in the brain. However, it still learns fast and efficient. But how is this possible? A sufficient part of learning in the brain is implemented as local changes in connections between neurons. We call this synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity as a learning mechanism is commonly used in spiking neural networks (SNNs) \u2013 a class of neural networks similar to the real brain.\n\nIn this seminar, we will work with synaptic plasticity in SNNs. We will learn about biologically-plausible learning mechanisms for spiking networks, such as: STDP, reward-modulated STDP, BCM, intrinsic plasticity, homeostatic plasticity, etc. We will engage in programming of spiking neural networks in Python, with the focus on these and similar learning mechanisms. \n\nThe seminar is aimed at master and higher semester bachelor students who are interested to know how the brain learns, and how to model it. Intermediate knowledge of Python is required, any knowledge about spiking networks would be ideal but not required. . Status: Seminar. Mode: hybrid. ECTS: 4. SWS: 2. Lecturer: ['Dr. rer. nat.

In 1913, he left his position at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt and became the director of the Prussian Academy of Sciences Anthropoid Research Station on the island of Tenerife, Canary Islands. He worked there for six years, during which he wrote his pioneering book \u201cThe Mentality of Apes\u201d (1917), focusing on the cognitive aspect of problem solving. K\u00f6hler carried out behavioural experiments with four chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), Chica, Grande, Konsul, and Sultan, involving for instance retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He showed that the chimpanzees stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders, to retrieve the food, or if the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms. K\u00f6hler concluded that these results provided evidence for \u2018insight\u2019 and planning in chimpanzees. He thereby challenged the hypothesis of Edward Thorndike (American psychologist), who had claimed that trial-and-error learning is the basis of all animal learning.\n\nK\u00f6hlers\u2019 research showed that the intellectual gap between humans and chimpanzees was much narrower than previously thought and was revolutionary when originally published in 1917 in German.

Description: Content and goal:\nIn this course, you will explore research approaching problems in computational cognitive neuroscience by considering systems interacting through cortico-cortical and thalamocortical loops. On a weekly basis, we will discuss classic and newly emerging research articles decided by the instructors and decided amongst the group during the course. Each student, or group of students, depending on the number of students enrolled, will be required to prepare and present at least one paper, to guide the group through it and to lead the in-depth discussion. By the end of the course, you will have a wide understanding of the common conceptualizations and trends in this direction of research. You will be better at parsing papers - getting to the central messages quickly and assessing the validity of the claims being made.\n\nTarget audience:\nMaster students who have at least completed an introductory course in cognitive neuroscience or neurobiology and an introductory course to deep learning. Highly motivated bachelors students are welcome. Bear in mind that the course content will be complex.\n\nNumber of participants:\nThe number of participants in this course is limited. If more students than the maximum number apply, we will choose a subgroup based on fulfillment of course criteria (see \"target audience\" above), as well as past experience and, likely, motivation letters. The exact procedure will be communicated in the first session once we can tell how many students are actively taking part.\n\nGrading:\nThe course will be completed with a written report, to be handed in by each student, in which you will be asked to answer a guiding question or review a common theme among the papers covered. The course grade will be partly based on the weekly presentations and the report. . Status: Seminar. Mode: in person. ECTS: 4. SWS: 2.

Description: Spatial navigation is a multidimensional cognitive process that combines wayfinding and purposeful movement (K\u00f6nig et al., 2019). However, comprehending the intricacies of this phenomenon in humans still poses challenges. This project aims to understand how having human agents inside a virtual reality (VR) city can alter information retrieval after repeated free explorations in the city inspired by the methods used in Rounds and colleagues (2020).\n\nYour role would include activities such as:\n\n- Adjust and alter an already existing VR (Unity) project.\n- Recruit and measure participants.\n- Classify eye movements and analyze behavioral data.\n- Analyze EEG data, specifically event-related synchronization/desynchronization analysis.\n\nK\u00f6nig, S.

The multi-agent system simulates a microcosm of simple artificial organisms (agents) in a puzzle-foraging scenario, trained with reinforcement learning. We make use of DeepMind\u2019s MuJoCo physics engine to investigate emergent properties and dynamics between populations of agents, e.g. language, cooperation, and strategies.\n\nNote: This course can be attended by students starting new with their 1st part of a 2-semester study project in SS23, and students continuing their study project course from the previous semester. There is also a separate 1-semester interdisciplinary seminar accompanying the study project. Due to the high demand for last semester\u2019s study project with the same topic, new students will be given the chance to join the current project group with the same topic for another two semesters. Prerequisites are competence in programming and either basic experience with simulation frameworks such as Unity or MuJoCo or basic knowledge of ML / RL. However, please note that due to the high demand, only a limited amount of new students can be admitted.\n\nWe have received a high volume of interest in this project and to that end, we are compelled to conduct a selection process to provide a meaningful organization and supervision for all participants. As part of the selection process, we will be requesting applicants to submit a brief essay that introduces themselves and their motivation for participating in the project. This will help us to better understand each candidate and determine the best fit for the program. More information on that will be announced around two weeks before the course starts. While I cannot guarantee your acceptance into the study project at this time, I encourage you to apply with regard to the course prerequisites. ",

We will trace the history of C(N)P to better understand how contemporary research is rooted in or presents alternatives to classical studies and the computational theory of the mind, respectively. Special emphasis will be laid on understanding the architecture of the brain, the function of specific brain areas, as well as method(olog)ical advances in neuroscientific paradigms, such as PET, fMRI, EEG/ERP, and TMS. Core and selected areas of C(N)P will be covered, such as (visual) perception, attention, memory, mental imagery, knowledge representation, decision making, reasoning, (sign) language, development or social cognition. The importance of mechanistic explanations of the functioning of the human mind/brain and the rationale of empirical studies will be outlined.\nThe main textbook is Anderson (2020, 9th edition). In addition, relevant recent literature will be included to point out current and future research trajectories. Furthermore, practical implications and applications of C(N)P in real-life will be highlighted.\nThis course will be taught in hybrid format.

Description: In this course, we will teach you the skills and tools you need for Scientific Programming in Python. \nThe rough outline of the course is as follows: \nOur first step will be to setup Python on our local machines, together with some tools that will improve our workflow. Then in the next 2 weeks we will cover plain or vanilla Python (no external packages).\nAfter that, we will dive into common Python packages used for scientific computing, such as NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for tabular data processing and Matplotlib for visualization. The last few lectures as well as the final project topics will be guided by the interests of the participants of this course.  . Status: Lecture. Mode: hybrid. ECTS: 4. SWS: 2.

            "soup": "Title: Introduction to Metaethics (B). Description: It seems that people disagree about a whole range of moral issues - from concrete cases like animal testing to abstract problems like the right basic moral principles. How can we make sense of this? Are there moral facts to which we can refer? What sort of facts would they be? Can moral statements be true or false? Or are moral judgments rather expressions of subjective feelings? Is \"You were wrong to lie to me\" just the same as \"You lied to me\", said with emotional disapproval?\nCan we be relativists, so that everyone should act according to the moral principles they find plausible? Would this mean that we cannot argue against someone whose principles make lying no problem at all?\n\nMetaethics is about questions like these. The course is at an elementary level. We will start with chapters from\nAndrew Fisher: Metaethics. An Introduction.\nThe book is available online in the library.\nThis will introduce us to the main questions and positions in the field.\nWe will then look at some specific issues in more detail.\n\nThe emphasis will be on collective discussion of the issues. Therefore, participants should be present on a regular basis. The exact requirements of the seminar will be discussed at the first meeting.\n\nThe course lasts 4 hours and is worth 8 credits. We will have a regular coffee break together :-)\n\nThe course is formally divided into Part A and Part B in order to fit into the philosophy module of the bachelor's programme. 4 credit points can be used for the compulsory optional philosophy module and 4 for the free optional module. The two parts (8-10 and 10-12) can only be taken together, the separation is purely formal. . Status: Seminar. Mode: in person. ECTS: 4. SWS: 2. Lecturer: ['Priv.Doz. Dr. phil. Uwe Meyer'].

It is targeted at both, master and bachelor students without or with very little knowledge in programming who want to get involved in Cognitive Science-subjects that require programming skills.\n\nThe course will also serve as an introduction to the programming language Python. However, those who are interested in Python but already have basic programming skills in another language (e.g. Java from Informatik A) should have a look at the course \"Scientific Programming in Python\" instead.\n\nTo pass the course, you will have to complete a number of homeworks, which will serve as an opportunity for you to apply what you have learnt in the lectures. .

Recent advances in computational object recognition, robotics, and machine learning, combined with the miniaturization of hardware, offer many opportunities for digital personal assistance. If there are self-driving cars soon, why not use similar camera-based approaches to assist humans in everyday tasks, like shopping and wayfinding? Especially for seniors and those with mild to severe impairments, technology can be the key to self-determined partaking in society.\n\nHow? Today, we have a tactile navigation belt for the blind that makes them feel orientation and navigation cues, utilizing vibration around the waist [1]. Tomorrow, we want to offer the individual user situationally adapted assistance in real-time for various everyday tasks like shopping in the local supermarket [2]. For this, the team will be using cutting-edge approaches of deep-neural-network-based object recognition, combined with tactile displays as the user interface and psychophysical tests for validation of the approach.\n\nEngel AK, Maye A, Kurthen M and K\u00f6nig P (2013) Where's the action?

Recent advances in computational object recognition, robotics, and machine learning, combined with the miniaturization of hardware, offer many opportunities for digital personal assistance. If there are self-driving cars soon, why not use similar camera-based approaches to assist humans in everyday tasks, like shopping and wayfinding? Especially for seniors and those with mild to severe impairments, technology can be the key to self-determined partaking in society.\n\nHow? Today, we have a tactile navigation belt for the blind that makes them feel orientation and navigation cues, utilizing vibration around the waist [1]. Tomorrow, we want to offer the individual user situationally adapted assistance in real-time for various everyday tasks like shopping in the local supermarket [2]. For this, the team will be using cutting-edge approaches of deep-neural-network-based object recognition, combined with tactile displays as the user interface and psychophysical tests for validation of the approach.\n\nEngel AK, Maye A, Kurthen M and K\u00f6nig P (2013) Where's the action?

The goal of this project is to make this insights more accessible by creating a (mobile) app that can provide personalized recommendations.\n\nThe project will be supported by Prof. Quoidbach (Barcelona), a distinguished researcher in the field, who has already collected large body of data and launched the development of an app, which can serve as a starting point. The project can extend this app in different directions, for example by using machine learning to better understand structures in the collected data and provide the user with personalized feedback or by searching for the latest happiness interventions from literature.\n\nThere are no hard requirements for participating in this course. Some basic knowledge in statistics, machine learning, and coding (or the willingness to spent some time in learning it) as well as an interest in the science of well-being are sufficient to join this project. .

In 1913, he left his position at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt and became the director of the Prussian Academy of Sciences Anthropoid Research Station on the island of Tenerife, Canary Islands. He worked there for six years, during which he wrote his pioneering book \u201cThe Mentality of Apes\u201d (1917), focusing on the cognitive aspect of problem solving. K\u00f6hler carried out behavioural experiments with four chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), Chica, Grande, Konsul, and Sultan, involving for instance retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He showed that the chimpanzees stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders, to retrieve the food, or if the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms. K\u00f6hler concluded that these results provided evidence for \u2018insight\u2019 and planning in chimpanzees.

In the first part of the study project \u2018The mentality of apes by Wolfgang K\u00f6hler: One century later\u2019 (WS 2022/2023, SS 2023), we will re-read the original book and re-evaluate the findings and its influence on studies of animal \u2018insight\u2019, \u2018tool-use\u2019 and \u2018future planning\u2019. .

In this course, we are going to first look at cases of language acquisition with insufficient input, focusing on language development in children who are blind, deaf, and deaf-blind. We will see how language evolves in these groups and what it tells us about the linguistic faculties of the human mind more generally in light of nature/nature debate. The second part of the course is devoted to the putative double dissociation between linguistic and other cognitive abilities. We will look at this question through the prism of Williams Syndrome - a cognitive disorder where individuals show an uneven cognitive profile with severe deficits in spatial and numerical cognition but strong language skills. We are going to compare this case to Specific Language Impairment - a case when a language impairment is not accompanied by other cognitive deficits. Finally, we are going to explore pragmatic knowledge in speakers with autism, looking into whether typical pragmatic tasks such as implicature calculation require general theory of mind reasoning or rely on other mechanisms and are therefore intact in this population.

It has no formal prerequisites, however, having taken the Foundations of Cognitive Science or an introductory philosophy course would be beneficial.\nContent: The role of culture in cognitive science is a timely topic, given the cross-cultural scope of studying cognition, both in theory and in practise. Cultures are increasingly more in contact with each other through globalization and digitalization. \nAre there aspects of cognition that are universal and thus pertain to all human beings in the same way?

A central theme in this respect is the distinction between \u201cCritical Thinking\u201d and \u201cDialectical Thinking\u201d. Critical Thinking is the ability to critically assess alternative accounts and to decide among them according to rational and logical means. (It is thought to be central in academic education and prevalent in individualistic Western societies). Dialectical thinking, on the other hand, includes multiple perspectives and tries to find a middle way between oppositions and even contradictions.

Hitherto critical thinking has been conceived of as an objective \u201cskill\u201d \u2013 however, dialectical thinking as a subjective \u201ctendency\u201d.

In addition, we will study what approaches and methods can be applied to study spatial cognition and eventually will discuss how these could be improved.\n\nDuring each meeting, a number of participants will present a new article, publication, talk, or similar selected from a folder in the course repository, followed by an open discussion of the same length.

            "soup": "Title: Journal Club \"Spatial Cognition\". Description: In this journal club we will discuss recent literature surrounding spatial navigation with a focus on the acquisition of spatial knowledge in the human brain. The literature we will discuss in the journal club covers relevant topics such as spatial navigation, the different types of spatial knowledge (i.e., landmark, route, or survey knowledge), spatial reference frames (i.e., egocentric or allocentric), reorientation illusions, and the role of the human brain in performing spatial tasks. In addition, we will study what approaches and methods can be applied to study spatial cognition and eventually will discuss how these could be improved.\n\nDuring each meeting, a number of participants will present a new article, publication, talk, or similar selected from a folder in the course repository, followed by an open discussion of the same length. The exact details will be provided during the first course meeting. For questions or remarks please contact: vincent.schmidt@uos.de . Status: Seminar. Mode: in person. ECTS: 4. SWS: None.

The goal of this seminar is to learn how Marxist Feminist theories and Black Marxist perspectives intersect and interact. We will discuss how Marxist Feminism addresses the exploitation of women in the capitalist system, highlighting the gendered aspects of labor and reproductive work. At the same time, we will analyze Black Marxism's perspective, highlighting its focus on racialized capitalism and structural racism in connection to Marxist thought. \nTogether, we will gain a deeper understanding of the work within the fields of Marxist Feminism and Black Marxism as well as their connection, and we will get critical insights into the complexities of power, oppression, and resistance.\n\nThe course will involve close reading of different texts from various fields, including philosophy, political theory, and critical race studies.

More recently, however, the principles developed here have also found application in the field of artificial intelligence ethics. The principles are: Respect for Autonomy, Nonmaleficence, Beneficence, and Justice. They are discussed from a more theoretical point of view as well as in relation to many applied problems (dilemma situations, use of placebos, paternalism,...).\nThe course lasts 4 hours and is worth 8 credits. We will have a regular coffee break together :-) The course is formally divided into Part A and Part B in order to fit into the philosophy module of the bachelor's programme. 4 credit points can be used for the compulsory optional philosophy module and 4 for the free optional module. The two parts (8-10 and 10-12) can only be taken together, the separation is purely formal.\nCriteria for sucessful participation will be discussed in the first meeting.In this seminar, we will read and discuss texts about all of these topics.

What are the sleep disorders and how do you treat them? How are certain psychopathologies such as depression related to sleep? How is sleep recorded? What technical devices and analysis tools facilitate the study of sleep? Why do we dream? What insights can we gain from lucid dream research for consciousness research?

We will provide more details soon via mail.\n\nThe goal in this course is to provide a broad overview of the topics of Sleep and dreams. We will discuss these questions: Why do we sleep? Which sleep stages fulfill which function (for example, memory consolidation)? What are the neurobiological bases of sleep? What happens during sleep deprivation? How is sleep researched? What are the sleep disorders and how do you treat them? How are certain psychopathologies such as depression related to sleep? How is sleep recorded? What technical devices and analysis tools facilitate the study of sleep? Why do we dream? What insights can we gain from lucid dream research for consciousness research? How do certain medications and other substances, or diet and exercise affect sleep?\nThe format of the course is to be a mix of presentations from the students and lecturers. . Status: Blockseminar.

The core of the experiment is a cooperative visual reference game, where both participants try to select high-reward boxes.\n\nThe catch: while only one person can see the reward of a box, the other person has to select it, and therefore, both participants must cooperate and work together non-verbally to win the game.\n\nThe study project will consist of several components:\n- Implementation and piloting of the experiment in virtual reality (Unity)\n- Writing the ethics proposal\n- Data collection\n- Data analysis\n- Writing a report .

In 1913, he left his position at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt and became the director of the Prussian Academy of Sciences Anthropoid Research Station on the island of Tenerife, Canary Islands. He worked there for six years, during which he wrote his pioneering book \u201cThe Mentality of Apes\u201d (1917), focusing on the cognitive aspect of problem solving. K\u00f6hler carried out behavioural experiments with four chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), Chica, Grande, Konsul, and Sultan, involving for instance retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He showed that the chimpanzees stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders, to retrieve the food, or if the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms. K\u00f6hler concluded that these results provided evidence for \u2018insight\u2019 and planning in chimpanzees. He thereby challenged the hypothesis of Edward Thorndike (American psychologist), who had claimed that trial-and-error learning is the basis of all animal learning.\n\nK\u00f6hlers\u2019 research showed that the intellectual gap between humans and chimpanzees was much narrower than previously thought and was revolutionary when originally published in 1917 in German. However, it was largely ignored for decades because it violated the traditional view that animal behavior and cognition is simply the result of instinct or conditioning.\nIn the first part of the study project \u2018The mentality of apes by Wolfgang K\u00f6hler: One century later\u2019 (WS 2022/2023, SS 2023), we will re-read the original book and re-evaluate the findings and its influence on studies of animal \u2018insight\u2019, \u2018tool-use\u2019 and \u2018future planning\u2019.
