Wie definieren wir \u00bbWissen\u00ab, \u00bbRechtfertigung\u00ab und andere verwandte Begriffe?\n- Wo liegen die Grenzen des menschlichen Erkennens? Worin sind unsere Wissensanspr\u00fcche begr\u00fcndet?\n- Welche Rolle spielen soziale Faktoren bei der Erkenntnissuche und -gewinnung?\n- Wie ist die Erkenntnis und selbst die Erkenntnistheorie von ethischen oder politischer Bedeutung?\n\nWissenschaftsphilosophie:\n- Was ist wissenschaftliches Wissen? Was untersucht die Wissenschaftsphilosophie?\n- Gibt es eine allgemeing\u00fcltige wissenschaftliche Methode, die bei richtiger Anwendung Fortschritt garantiert?\n- Wie w\u00e4hlen wir die beste unter konkurrierenden Theorien, besonders wenn die Datenlage uneindeutig ist?\n- Welche Rolle spielen Werte und Werturteile in den Wissenschaften?

Diese Fragen stehen beispielhaft f\u00fcr Situationen, in denen die Einwilligung einer oder mehrerer der beteiligten Personen gefragt ist. Aber was hei\u00dft das eigentlich, in etwas einzuwilligen? Reicht es, wenn ich als Antwort auf diese Fragen nicke oder l\u00e4chle? Muss ich mich verbal \u00e4u\u00dfern oder ist es ausreichend wenn ich selbst wei\u00df, dass das f\u00fcr mich in Ordnung geht? Und gibt es einen Unterschied zwischen verschiedenen Kontexten? \nUm diese Fragen und noch einige mehr soll es in diesem Seminar gehen. Gemeinsam werden wir diskutieren, was genau Einwilligung eigentlich ist, welche Bedingungen erf\u00fcllt sein m\u00fcssen, damit Einwilligung g\u00fcltig ist, in welcher Relation sie zu moralischen Rechten steht und was es hei\u00dft, dass die sogenannten normative powers (zu denen Einwilligung z\u00e4hlt) einen normativen Unterschied machen. Und weil - wie wir feststellen werden - es eben doch unterschiedliche Anforderungen an unterschiedliche Kontexte gibt, werden wir uns den spezifischen Fall sexueller Einwilligung anschauen. Gibt es etwas, dass sexuelle Begegnungen besonders macht, und worin sie sich von nicht-sexuellen Begegnungen unterscheiden? Und was \u00e4ndert sich dabei f\u00fcr Einwilligung, die in diesem Kontext h\u00e4ufig als der difference-maker zwischen sexualisierter Gewalt und sexueller Interaktion angesehen wird? \nDie f\u00fcr das Seminar erforderliche Literatur wird vollst\u00e4ndig bei stud.ip im entsprechenden Veranstaltungsordner hochgeladen. Die meisten - u.U. sogar alle - der zu lesenden Texte sind auf Englisch verfasst. Obwohl die Diskussionen im Seminar auf Deutsch stattfinden werden, wird ein gutes Verst\u00e4ndnis englischer Texte also vorausgesetzt. ",

Die Frage ist, ob die blo\u00dfe Nachahmung (z.B. in einem Gem\u00e4lde) bereits Kunst ist, oder ob Kunstwerke von Rang nur von sch\u00f6pferischen Genies erschaffen werden k\u00f6nnen.\nIm letzten Teil des Seminars soll es dann um die moderne Kunst gehen \u2013 und damit um das Ph\u00e4nomen der bewussten und oftmals provokanten Grenz\u00fcberschreitung.

Viele Philosophen haben sich explizit gefragt, was es hei\u00dft zu denken, und insbesondere philosophisch zu denken. Die Antworten bezeugen in ihrer Verschiedenheit die enorme Vielfalt der Philosophie. Gleichwohl gibt es ein wiederkehrendes Leitmotiv: die philosophische Haltung besteht darin, sich nicht mit oberfl\u00e4chlichen Meinungen zufrieden zu geben, sondern kritisch nachzufragen und den Dingen auf den Grund zu gehen.

K\u00f6nnen wir allein mithilfe der Vernunft Gottes Existenz beweisen? Erlaubt uns unsere Erfahrung, auf diese zu schlie\u00dfen?

Oder k\u00f6nnte es nicht-epistemische Gr\u00fcnde geben, weshalb es vielleicht doch eine gute Idee oder zumindest nicht unvern\u00fcnftig ist, an einen Gott zu glauben?\nWie man sieht, wirft die noch heute f\u00fcr viele Menschen bedeutende Frage nach der Existenz Gottes eine Reihe faszinierender Anschlussfragen auf, von denen hier nur ein paar genannt worden sind und \u00fcber die Philosophen seit der Antike streiten: Wer oder was ist Gott?

            "description": "Course Overview:\nIn this block course, students will be introduced to methods of automated scientific discovery, with a special focus on the discovery of scientific models of brain function and behavior. The course addresses a pressing issue in neuroscience and psychology: the accumulation of vast data sets without adequate time or resources for their integration into scientific theories. To tackle this, the course explores how other scientific fields have successfully incorporated artificial intelligence into their research processes. The course combines lectures with practical programming exercises, enabling participants to learn about and apply automated discovery techniques from physics and machine learning. These techniques will be used to develop models explaining human behavior and brain function. This course lays the groundwork for advanced study and research in the emerging field of automated scientific discovery.\n\nCourse Structure:\nThe block course consists of four blocks. Each block will contain a lecture introducing a topic of automated scientific discovery, followed by hands-on programming exercises in which students get to implement automated discovery techniques and apply them to real-world data sets. Students will also familiarize themselves with professional software development techniques, such as unit tests and code reviews. All programming exercises will be conducted in Python and facilitated through GitHub. By the end of the course, students will have acquired both the theoretical understanding and practical skills necessary for developing and applying automated model discovery techniques.\n\nSelection Process:\nThe course is limited to 20 participants. In case of higher demand, participants will be selected based on a lottery.\n\nAssessment:\nStudent performance may be evaluated through programming assignments and group projects focused on automated scientific discovery.

Investigating various phenomena ranging from addictive interface design of social media, and targeted advertising to AI Beauty Filters, in our previous work we have organized school lessons at high schools, facilitated workshops for various audiences, designed games and websites and curated an event at Kunsthalle Osnabr\u00fcck.\n\nStarting this summer term, our study project will pursue a new focus area. Introducing \"Predicted Futures?\" as our new topic, we will investigate how big-data-driven technologies are shaping \u2013 and perhaps predetermining \u2013 the future.  \n\nThe following questions will guide us on this investigation: How are big-data-driven technologies applied to predict our behaviour, interests, emotions, desires or health? In which way do they actually path the way into a predetermined future, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy? What are the politics behind the urge and the application of predictive analytics that make it seem as an acceptable way of solving the polycrises of today? And how are common narratives of tech-determinism and tech-solutionism prefiguring our understanding of possible futures? What could alternative, inclusive and sustainable futures look like? And what role would AI play in it?\n\nWe are excited to embark on this journey in collaboration with Theater Osnabr\u00fcck, Kunsthalle Osnabr\u00fcck, Museum f\u00fcr Industriekultur and various regional schools. As a cornerstone of the project, we aim to encourage an intergenerational dialogue on desirable tech-futures. Based on the theater play \"(R)Evolution\" we will work with high-school students and engage them into a conversation about the realities of AI and their visions for the future.\n\nParticipation opportunities\nWe are inviting both Study project (2 Semesters, 12 ECTS each), as well as Interdisciplinary course (1 Semester, 6 ECTS) participants to join us. Interdisciplinary participants will work on a project of smaller scope. There will be two focus areas:\n\nA) Workshop Track (7\u20138 students in total)\nIn groups of 2\u20133 students you are conceptualizing, developing and testing a workshop for high school students on the basis of the theater play. You will document your findings during the workshop and create an Open Educational Resource (OER) for further circulation. Depending on availabilities your group might also organize workshops at the Museum of Industriekultur, which is hosting an exhibition on AI this summer. \nGerman fluency necessary!\n\nB) Research Track (3\u20134 students in total)\nYou accompany the workshops and, on the basis of participatory observation, record the results of the vision-finding processes. Based on these findings, you are preparing an academic paper. Possible areas of focus:\nA) Investigate younger generations' perspectives on the challenges of technological and socio-ecological change and how they can be made more visible and audible in the public discourse in a constructive way. \nB) Reflect the methodology of the visioning work with students and formulate qualitative findings on the intergenerational dialog on AI futures.\nGerman fluency is an advantage.\n\nParticipation requirements\n- Prior knowledge in the field of data ethics. Ideally, completion of the lecture \"Intro to Ethics of AI\" or similar lectures/seminars. (See the preregistration form for more info).\n- On site participation, Tuesdays 2\u20135 pm\n- Due to the close collaboration with local cultural institutions this semester, sufficient German skills (~B2) are necessary. However, we would make an exception for up to 3 students who would work on a research-focused project.\n\nIf you are interested in joining us, please fill out this form until March 26th, noon:  https://cloud.ethikderki.de/index.php/apps/forms/s/nzC7G45M9d58qbQYJTib6qHj\n\nA second round of preregistration might be opened later, depending on availabilities.\n\nWe are looking forward to your responses and an insightful next semester!

A particular focus will be contemporary data-driven and machine learning-based AI technology and its applications in digital consumer media. As we will see, questions of social equality and fairness are central to today's ethical concerns about AI, so that ethics needs to adopt a societal perspective, analyzing constellations of power, subjectivation, discrimination and subordination that relate to AI technology. Ethics will be framed in relation to intersectional critical philosophy, feminist and post-colonial theories.

Goff's view is a contemporary form of panpsychism. Drawing on the work of Bertrand Russell, one of the central figures of early analytic philosophy, Goff argues that science tells us a lot about the structure of things, but it does not tell us anything about the nature of the things that are so structured. This is where consciousness comes into play. Furthermore, Goff believes that his account provides the basis for a solution to the problem of fine tuning - an account of why the natural constants in the Universe are the way they are - that opens up a middle ground between theism and multiverse theory and allows for a form of moral realism. Even though his view is quite radical and difficult to accept, skeptics of the view can still learn a lot from closely investigating Goff's line of reasoning. \n\nMain readings: \n- Goff, P.

            "description": "In the early 1980s, the neuroscientist Benjamin Libet decided to make the philosophical claim that people have free will empirically testable. He instructed subjects to freely decide within the next minute or so to make a simple voluntary motor movement, like flexing their hand. He measured the exact time of the onset of muscular acitivity in order to determine the time of the movement (M). He also invented an ingenious device in order to measure the exact time when people first became consciously aware of their decision to execute the movement (W). Lastly, he used EEG to record the exact time of the onset of the Readiness Potential, a neural activity that precedes motor movements (RP). \n\nThe findings of Libet's experiments were as follows: RP preceeded M by about 550MS. That is, it apparently takes the brain about half a second to initiate a simple motor movement. However, W preceeded M by about only 200MS. W (the 'conscious will') thus occured only about a third of a second AFTER the brain had already begun to initiate the movement! For that reason, Libet's experiments and others along similar lines have ever since been said to show that \"Free Will is an Illusion\", that the conscious will simply comes too late for it to have any impact on what we do. \n\nThis, of course, has sparked some controversy. Part of the controversy is philosophical. Philosophers have, for example, questioned whether Libet's notion of free will is viable, whether it is the kind of free will worth caring about. Interestingly, however, part of the controversy is also empirical. There are lots and lots of methodological problems with Libet-style experiments that do not throw doubt on the philosophical interpretation of Libet's results, but on the viability of the results themselves.

            "title": "Episodic Cognition",
            "description": "Episodic cognition comprises episodic memory and episodic future thinking. (The term \u201cepisodic memory\u201d is much more known than the other terms, \u201cepisodic future thinking\u201d or \u201cepisodic cognition\u201d.) If episodic memory is the memory of daily personal experiences (\u201cthings that happened to me yesterday, or 10 years ago\u201d), then episodic future thinking is the prospection of things that may happen to me tomorrow or in 10 years. Importantly, episodes (past or future) carry www information: what, where and when. That is, the content of our memory (what happened) is remembered in its spatio-temporal context (where, when). That\u2019s why this kind of memory is also called \u201crelational\u201d memory. The same holds for episodic future thinking: I am imagining myself experiencing something at a certain place and time. How do I do this? By mental time travel, i.e., I project myself into my personal past or future. Mental time travel is characterized by chronesthesia \u2013 a sense of time and autonoesis \u2013 a sense of self: knowing that this has happened/will happen to me.\nIn this course, we will discuss various aspects of episodic cognition:\nHow episodic memory differs from semantic memory and from autobiographic memory in the memory taxonomy.\nHow philosophers conceive of episodic cognition: Is it a \u201cnatural kind\u201d? \u2013 as compared to other forms of memory, in particular when we consider its sequential character. What does it \u201cfeel like\u201d to have an episodic memory, how do these past (or future) episodes appear to us (phenomenologically)?\nWhich (distinct) brain areas support episodic memory and future thinking? Prime candidates are the hippocampus with its place and time cells and the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL).\nHow does episodic cognition develop in children? Endel Tulving (who is a big figure in episodic memory research) claimed that children under 4 years of age do not have episodic memory at all! Now we know that episodic memory develops heavily between 3-5 years of age (and episodic future thinking a bit later). We also have an idea which cognitive abilities support it (executive function, language).\nWhen we think of a past or envision a future episode we often detach our eye-gaze from the objects around us or our interlocutor and look into the void (e.g., we stare at the ceiling or into the sky). Do such \u201cnon-visual eye-movements\u201d tell us anything about episodic cognition? Do we construct our episodes mentally while we are seemingly \u201clooking at nothing\u201d?\nDo non-human animals have episodic cognition? For a long time this was not held possible (mainly because they cannot tell you!). Animals were thought to be \u201cstuck in time\u201d, i.e., not capable of mental time travel.

If episodic memory is the memory of daily personal experiences (\u201cthings that happened to me yesterday, or 10 years ago\u201d), then episodic future thinking is the prospection of things that may happen to me tomorrow or in 10 years. Importantly, episodes (past or future) carry www information: what, where and when. That is, the content of our memory (what happened) is remembered in its spatio-temporal context (where, when). That\u2019s why this kind of memory is also called \u201crelational\u201d memory. The same holds for episodic future thinking: I am imagining myself experiencing something at a certain place and time. How do I do this? By mental time travel, i.e., I project myself into my personal past or future. Mental time travel is characterized by chronesthesia \u2013 a sense of time and autonoesis \u2013 a sense of self: knowing that this has happened/will happen to me.\nIn this course, we will discuss various aspects of episodic cognition:\nHow episodic memory differs from semantic memory and from autobiographic memory in the memory taxonomy.\nHow philosophers conceive of episodic cognition: Is it a \u201cnatural kind\u201d? \u2013 as compared to other forms of memory, in particular when we consider its sequential character.

Endel Tulving (who is a big figure in episodic memory research) claimed that children under 4 years of age do not have episodic memory at all! Now we know that episodic memory develops heavily between 3-5 years of age (and episodic future thinking a bit later). We also have an idea which cognitive abilities support it (executive function, language).\nWhen we think of a past or envision a future episode we often detach our eye-gaze from the objects around us or our interlocutor and look into the void (e.g., we stare at the ceiling or into the sky).

The aim of this seminar is to provide comprehensive insights into language evolution, covering both biological and cultural changes. We will explore thought-provoking questions based on theories of language evolution, the differences between human and animal communication and the reasons for humans' ability to acquire a vast vocabulary compared to our closest ancestors. Through exploring neurocognitive and comparative experimental research, we will examine the underlying mechanisms in the human mind and brain that govern language processing, usage, and evolution. The course will emphasize linguistic pragmatics, a sub-discipline that studies language as a communication tool in social contexts, drawing on foundational concepts from analytical philosophy and linguistic pragmatic models and linking this to language evolution theories.

In this context, participants will gain several practical insights into how neurocomputational brain models can be trained, and tested for simulating language learning processes, including the exploration of language deficits induced by virtual lesions in these models. \n\nReadings:\nHickok, G., Small, S.

(ii) And can you do this with local update (plasticity) rules that use local information only? (iii) How do you learn a neural network or neuron model that uses spikes very efficiently and still finds a good representation of a continuous input stream?.

The course will be composed of a few lectures, that are a mix between lectures and open dialog seminars- This way you can interact with lectures, ask question and learn very individually. After the first two days on 30 and 31st of May, we will transit in a project phase. In this phase you can either work on real project with a direct link to neuromorphic computing, your dive deep in a topic of your choice. In both cases we expect as 5-10 min long video presentation that you can hand in before the start of the next semester. ",

            "description": "Wolfgang K\u00f6hler (21 January 1887\u2013 11 June 1967) was a German Psychologist and phenomenologist. In 1913, he left his position at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt and became the director of the Prussian Academy of Sciences Anthropoid Research Station on the island of Tenerife, Canary Islands. He worked there for six years, during which he wrote his pioneering book \u201cThe Mentality of Apes\u201d (1917), focusing on the cognitive aspect of problem solving. K\u00f6hler carried out behavioural experiments with four chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), Chica, Grande, Konsul, and Sultan, involving for instance retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He showed that the chimpanzees stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders, to retrieve the food, or if the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms. K\u00f6hler concluded that these results provided evidence for \u2018insight\u2019 and planning in chimpanzees. He thereby challenged the hypothesis of Edward Thorndike (American psychologist), who had claimed that trial-and-error learning is the basis of all animal learning.\n\nK\u00f6hlers\u2019 research showed that the intellectual gap between humans and chimpanzees was much narrower than previously thought and was revolutionary when originally published in 1917 in German. However, it was largely ignored for decades because it violated the traditional view that animal behavior and cognition is simply the result of instinct or conditioning.\n\nIn the first part of the study project \u2018The mentality of apes by Wolfgang K\u00f6hler: One century later\u2019 (WS 2022/2023, SS 2023), we will re-read the original book and re-evaluate the findings and its influence on studies of animal \u2018insight\u2019, \u2018tool-use\u2019 and \u2018future planning\u2019. In the second part (WS 2023/2024; SS 2024), we will write and publish an edited version with linkages and discussions of our current knowledge on great apes\u2019 \u2018insight\u2019, \u2018tool-use\u2019 and \u2018future planning\u2019.

In 1913, he left his position at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt and became the director of the Prussian Academy of Sciences Anthropoid Research Station on the island of Tenerife, Canary Islands. He worked there for six years, during which he wrote his pioneering book \u201cThe Mentality of Apes\u201d (1917), focusing on the cognitive aspect of problem solving. K\u00f6hler carried out behavioural experiments with four chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), Chica, Grande, Konsul, and Sultan, involving for instance retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He showed that the chimpanzees stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders, to retrieve the food, or if the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms. K\u00f6hler concluded that these results provided evidence for \u2018insight\u2019 and planning in chimpanzees. He thereby challenged the hypothesis of Edward Thorndike (American psychologist), who had claimed that trial-and-error learning is the basis of all animal learning.\n\nK\u00f6hlers\u2019 research showed that the intellectual gap between humans and chimpanzees was much narrower than previously thought and was revolutionary when originally published in 1917 in German. However, it was largely ignored for decades because it violated the traditional view that animal behavior and cognition is simply the result of instinct or conditioning.\n\nIn the first part of the study project \u2018The mentality of apes by Wolfgang K\u00f6hler: One century later\u2019 (WS 2022/2023, SS 2023), we will re-read the original book and re-evaluate the findings and its influence on studies of animal \u2018insight\u2019, \u2018tool-use\u2019 and \u2018future planning\u2019.

            "description": "In this study project, the group will work together to further develop a multi-agent system. The multi-agent system simulates a microcosm of simple artificial organisms (agents) in a puzzle-foraging scenario, trained with reinforcement learning. We make use of DeepMind\u2019s MuJoCo physics engine to investigate emergent properties and dynamics between populations of agents, e.g. language, cooperation, and strategies.\n\nNote: This course can be attended by students starting new with their 1st part of a 2-semester study project in SS23, and students continuing their study project course from the previous semester. There is also a separate 1-semester interdisciplinary seminar accompanying the study project. Due to the high demand for last semester\u2019s study project with the same topic, new students will be given the chance to join the current project group with the same topic for another two semesters. Prerequisites are competence in programming and either basic experience with simulation frameworks such as Unity or MuJoCo or basic knowledge of ML / RL. However, please note that due to the high demand, only a limited amount of new students can be admitted.\n\nWe have received a high volume of interest in this project and to that end, we are compelled to conduct a selection process to provide a meaningful organization and supervision for all participants. As part of the selection process, we will be requesting applicants to submit a brief essay that introduces themselves and their motivation for participating in the project. This will help us to better understand each candidate and determine the best fit for the program. More information on that will be announced around two weeks before the course starts. While I cannot guarantee your acceptance into the study project at this time, I encourage you to apply with regard to the course prerequisites. ",

We will trace the history of C(N)P to better understand how contemporary research is rooted in or presents alternatives to classical studies and the computational theory of the mind, respectively. Special emphasis will be laid on understanding the architecture of the brain, the function of specific brain areas, as well as method(olog)ical advances in neuroscientific paradigms, such as PET, fMRI, EEG/ERP, and TMS. Core and selected areas of C(N)P will be covered, such as (visual) perception, attention, memory, mental imagery, knowledge representation, decision making, reasoning, (sign) language, development or social cognition. The importance of mechanistic explanations of the functioning of the human mind/brain and the rationale of empirical studies will be outlined.\nThe main textbook is Anderson (2020, 9th edition). In addition, relevant recent literature will be included to point out current and future research trajectories. Furthermore, practical implications and applications of C(N)P in real-life will be highlighted.\nThis course will be taught in hybrid format. It may be attended on-site, on-line, as well as asynchronously. Methods of instruction comprise classical lectures, impulse lectures, flipped classroom, and critical discussions in the classroom (onsite and online), as well as rehearsals.

Both variants are open for all students.\nThe course is on an introductory level.\n\nIn the first part of the seminar, we will talk about basic and general philosophical approaches to ethics: Consequentialism/utilitarianism, deontological theories, virtue ethics, etc. In the second part, we will discuss more applied topics related to cognitive science: Data ethics, ethical problems concerning highly automated systems like \u201cautonomous cars\u201d or drones, \u201conline friendship\u201d, specific moral problems of Big Data, and the like; also animal testing. . Status: Seminar. Mode: in person. ECTS: 6. SWS: 2. Lecturer: Meyer. Module: ['CS-BWP-PHIL - Philosophy for Cognitive Science']. Area: ['Veranstaltungen > Cognitive Science > Bachelor-Programm']."

The projects can be chosen from a list provided by the instructors or decided jointly with students and instructors. The course will begin with in-depth discussions to help you decide the details of the projects. In the subsequent weekly meetings, you will provide brief summaries of your progress - what is done, what are the roadblocks, and what are the next steps, and the group and instructors will provide guidance on how to proceed further. Students will be required to review each-other\u2019s code to learn to write clearly/accessibly, and to take the perspective of an external code-reviewer. By the end you will have completed a project at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning, you will have learned to review code, to communicate problems, and you will have gotten an in-depth insight into the research field as such.

            "description": "Die Wissenschaft \u00fcbt einen erheblichen Einfluss auf unser Leben aus, sowohl in Bezug auf unsere \u00dcberzeugungen \u00fcber die nat\u00fcrliche und soziale Welt, als auch hinsichtlich der vielf\u00e4ltigen Technologien, die erst durch wissenschaftliche Forschung erm\u00f6glicht werden. Wir vertrauen oft (aber nicht immer) auf die Wissenschaft und investieren eine betr\u00e4chtliche Menge an Ressourcen \u2013 Geld, Zeit und Energie \u2013 in Forschung, \u00fcber die Laien in der Regel kaum etwas verstehen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nDoch was ist eigentlich Wissenschaft? Wie wissen wir, was dazu geh\u00f6rt und was nicht? Es gibt n\u00e4mlich auch eine Vielzahl von menschlichen Praktiken und Bestrebungen, deren von einigen behauptete Wissenschaftlichkeit regelm\u00e4\u00dfig infrage gestellt wird. W\u00e4hrend wir uns mehr oder weniger einig sind, dass die Astronomie eine legitime Wissenschaft darstellt, herrscht mehr Uneinigkeit dar\u00fcber, ob dasselbe f\u00fcr die Astrologie gilt. Die Sache wird noch komplizierter, wenn man die Wissenschaftsgeschichte betrachtet: Zum Beispiel gab es nicht immer eine klare Abgrenzung zwischen Astronomie und Astrologie, und einige hochgelobte Wissenschaftler*innen aus dem Bereich der Astronomie betrachteten in ihrer Zeit das Erstellen von Horoskopen als eine legitime wissenschaftliche Besch\u00e4ftigung u.a.\n\nIn diesem Seminar befassen wir uns mit der Frage, wie die Wissenschaft von anderen menschlichen Bestrebungen und Aktivit\u00e4ten im Allgemeinen (also von \"Nichtwissenschaft\") sowie von \"Pseudowissenschaften\" im Besonderen abzugrenzen ist, bzw. ob es \u00fcberhaupt m\u00f6glich ist, eine klare Trennung vorzunehmen. Es gibt drei thematische Bl\u00f6cke: Im ersten Block setzen wir uns (grob) mit einigen historischen Perspektiven \u00fcber das Wesen der Wissenschaft auseinander; im zweiten besch\u00e4ftigen wir uns mit der sehr einflussreichen Idee von Karl Popper, wonach Falsifizierbarkeit als Abgrenzungskriterium zwischen Wissenschaft und Nichtwissenschaft dienen soll; und im dritten lesen wir einige Kapitel aus einem neueren Buch von Lee McIntyre mit dem Titel Wir lieben Wissenschaft: Mit einer wissenschaftlichen Grundhaltung gegen Betrug, Leugnung und Pseudowissenschaft (orig. The Scientific Attitude: Defending Science from Denial, Fraud, and Pseudoscience), in dem versucht wird, den Kern der Wissenschaftlichkeit in einer Art von kritischer Grundhaltung statt (wie z.B. bei Popper) in einer bestimmten \"wissenschaftlichen Methode\" zu finden.

We often (but not always) rely on science and invest a considerable amount of resources \u2013 money, time and energy \u2013 in research about which lay people usually can hardly understand anything. But what is science? How do we know what belongs to it and what is not? There are also a variety of human practices and aspirations, which some claimed science regularly questions. While we are more or less agreed that astronomy is a legitimate science, there is more disagreement as to whether the same applies to astrology. The matter becomes even more complicated when one considers the history of science: for example, there was not always a clear distinction between astronomy and astrology, and some highly acclaimed scientists from the field of astronomy considered in their time the creation of horoscopes as a legitimate scientific occupation, among others.In this seminar, we deal with the question of how to distinguish science from other human aspirations and activities in general (i.e. from \"non-science\") and from \"pseudosciences\" in particular, respectively. whether it is even possible to make a clear separation. There are three thematic blocks: In the first block, we deal (grob) with some historical perspectives on the nature of science; in the second, we deal with the very influential idea of Karl Popper, according to which falsification should serve as a criterion for demarcation between science and non-science; and in the third, we read a few chapters from a recent book by Lee McIntyre entitled We Love Science: With a basic scientific stance against fraud, denial and pseudoscience (orig.

However, those who are interested in Python but already have basic programming skills in another language (e.g. Java from Informatik A) should have a look at the course \"Scientific Programming in Python\" instead.\n\nTo pass the course, you will have to complete a number of homeworks, which will serve as an opportunity for you to apply what you have learnt in the lectures. .

Description: In recent years, many new technologies have been developed to enhance the perceptual and intellectual abilities of the user. Some examples are: improving the user's memory and attention, creating a new sensory modality to perceive the magnetic north, and sharpening the user's aesthetic and moral perceptions.\n\nIntegrating all these approaches, a long-term goal of this research is to develop a generally applicable framework for sense enhancement by cognitive technologies. As the first step to realizing this vision, this study project aims to develop a sense enhancement prototype to create a new sensory modality to perceive safety and evaluate its cognitive impact on the users. This project will be conducted within the scope of a bilateral exchange-of-scientists program with Prof. Dr. Bipin Indurkhya and Prof. Dr. Arthur Gunia from Jagiellonian University Krakow.\n\nOur goal is to create awareness for the bike rider by incorporating objects and people in the vicinity.

In 1913, he left his position at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt and became the director of the Prussian Academy of Sciences Anthropoid Research Station on the island of Tenerife, Canary Islands. He worked there for six years, during which he wrote his pioneering book \u201cThe Mentality of Apes\u201d (1917), focusing on the cognitive aspect of problem solving. K\u00f6hler carried out behavioural experiments with four chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), Chica, Grande, Konsul, and Sultan, involving for instance retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He showed that the chimpanzees stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders, to retrieve the food, or if the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms. K\u00f6hler concluded that these results provided evidence for \u2018insight\u2019 and planning in chimpanzees. He thereby challenged the hypothesis of Edward Thorndike (American psychologist), who had claimed that trial-and-error learning is the basis of all animal learning. K\u00f6hlers\u2019 research showed that the intellectual gap between humans and chimpanzees was much narrower than previously thought and was revolutionary when originally published in 1917 in German. However, it was largely ignored for decades because it violated the traditional view that animal behavior and cognition is simply the result of instinct or conditioning. In the first part of the study project \u2018The mentality of apes by Wolfgang K\u00f6hler: One century later\u2019 (WS 2022/2023, SS 2023), we will re-read the original book and re-evaluate the findings and its influence on studies of animal \u2018insight\u2019, \u2018tool-use\u2019 and \u2018future planning\u2019.

Therefore, about the first half of the talks will be based on chapters from the Sonification Handbook by Hermann, Hunt, and Neuhoff on sonification.de.\n\nIntroductory part:\nTalk 1: Chapters 1-2   \nTalk 2: Chapters 3-4\nTalk 3: Chapters 5+7\n\nTalk 1 is on October 26th.\n\nFor talks 4-7, you can choose from the chapters of the Sonification Handbook and send me your suggestions.\n\nFor talks 8-13, you need to select 1-2 papers from the proceedings of the ICAD icad.org and email your idea to me. It's up to you what you find most interesting!\n\nYou may find the information given in the book chapters or papers insufficient, in this case, you need to find missing information yourself and provide necessary background in your talk. Further, demonstrations and suitable videos / sound files are highly welcome to improve your presentation.\n\n\nRules:\n\n- Enroll for the seminar by September 15th at the latest. Talks will be assigned in order of registration if necessary.\n- Together with enrollment, send me an email with you name, preferred day for the presentation and at least three topics you might present in the order of preference.\n- I will assign the topics and days, and publish this under Ablaufplan.\n- The participants will give presentations of about one hour plus 30 minutes discussion.\n- One person per talk, alternatively, you can team up and two persons present two talks (on two days) together.\n- We want to understand methods in reasonable detail, a mere overview is not enough.\n- Slides must be sent to me at least 1 week in advance to the talk.

Cultures are increasingly more in contact with each other through globalization and digitalization. \nAre there aspects of cognition that are universal and thus pertain to all human beings in the same way? Or are cognitive processes inherently shaped by cultural beliefs, norms, and practises? In this seminar, we will critically assess the role of culture in cognition and cognitive science. A central theme in this respect is the distinction between \u201cCritical Thinking\u201d and \u201cDialectical Thinking\u201d. Critical Thinking is the ability to critically assess alternative accounts and to decide among them according to rational and logical means. (It is thought to be central in academic education and prevalent in individualistic Western societies). Dialectical thinking, on the other hand, includes multiple perspectives and tries to find a middle way between oppositions and even contradictions. (Is is thought to be prevalent in collectivistic Eastern societies). Hitherto critical thinking has been conceived of as an objective \u201cskill\u201d \u2013 however, dialectical thinking as a subjective \u201ctendency\u201d. We will address this classical distinction critically as well as dialectically. Other topics include the role of culture in perception, memory, language, cognitive development, and its influence on neurophysiological processes.\nMode of conduct: This is a hybrid course. Students will make presentations on scheduled topics in class and discuss them with the audience.

            "description": "Die Familie hat f\u00fcr das Leben der Menschen eine gro\u00dfe Bedeutung: Wir alle sind Mitglieder einer Familie und die meisten Menschen teilen, auch \u00fcber die Kindheit hinaus, gro\u00dfe Teile ihres Lebens und ihrer Lebenszeit mit ihren Familienangeh\u00f6rigen. Vielen Menschen sind diese Familienbeziehung kostbar, andere erleben sie als einengend und belastend. Im einen wie im anderen Fall werfen sie eine ganze Reihe interessanter moralphilosophischer Fragen auf. Im Kern geht es dabei darum, dar\u00fcber nachzudenken, worin der Wert und das Wesen von Familie besteht, wodurch sich Familienbeziehungen auszeichnen und welche Normen, Tugenden und Regeln dazu beitragen, dass diese Beziehungen moralisch gelingen: Welche besonderen moralischen Pflichten bestehen gegebenenfalls gegen\u00fcber den eigenen Eltern, Kindern, Geschwistern, Angeh\u00f6rigen und worauf beruhen sie? Welche Rolle spielt dabei der Umstand, dass Familien Zufallsgemeinschaften sind, die wir uns nicht ausgesucht haben? Und: Darf man seine Familie verlassen und die Beziehung \u2013 z.B. zu den eigenen Eltern \u2013 abbrechen oder stiehlt sich jemand, der das tut, aus einer moralischen Verantwortung, die wir zwar nicht freiwillig \u00fcbernommen haben aber auch nicht einfach abgeben k\u00f6nnen? Diese und andere Fragen wollen wir im Seminar auf der Basis einschl\u00e4giger philosophischer Texte und mithilfe vern\u00fcnftiger Argumente diskutieren. \n\n(Das Seminar ist eine Pr\u00e4senzveranstaltung!

            "description": "In this seminar, we will explore Aristotle's classic work on ethics, the Nicomachean Ethics. This work remains one of the most influential and widely studied ethical treatises in the Western tradition. Throughout the semester, we will work through the entire text and discuss Aristotle\u2019s arguments and ideas about the nature of the good life, human flourishing, and virtue. We will also debate to what extent Aristotle's ethics is still relevant in relation to ethics in the digital society. \n\nAgainst the backdrop of the contemporary framing of ethics as a discipline that produces \u201cguidelines\u201d and \u201cchecklists\u201d (which is particularly evident in the field of the ethics of artificial intelligence), Aristotle offers an opportunity to develop a richer and more comprehensive idea of ethics. As we shall see, the Aristotelian model of practical philosophy, which is called \"ethics\", integrates a theory of happiness, virtues, and right action, with a theory of the political as a specific way of social coexistence of people in a community.\n\nThis seminar is intended for students with an interest in philosophy and ethics, potentially in relation to contemporary ethical and political questions. By the end of the course, students will have a deep understanding of Aristotle's ethical theory and its relevance to a critical engagement with contemporary ethical debates. \n\nNo prerequisites. Participation involves reading the ~300 pages of Aristotle\u2019s ethics over the semester in weekly portions.\n\nThis is a hybrid class: Students can participate on site or remotely in Big Blue Button. A webcam is required for remote participation. ",

Throughout the semester, we will work through the entire text and discuss Aristotle\u2019s arguments and ideas about the nature of the good life, human flourishing, and virtue. We will also debate to what extent Aristotle's ethics is still relevant in relation to ethics in the digital society. \n\nAgainst the backdrop of the contemporary framing of ethics as a discipline that produces \u201cguidelines\u201d and \u201cchecklists\u201d (which is particularly evident in the field of the ethics of artificial intelligence), Aristotle offers an opportunity to develop a richer and more comprehensive idea of ethics. As we shall see, the Aristotelian model of practical philosophy, which is called \"ethics\", integrates a theory of happiness, virtues, and right action, with a theory of the political as a specific way of social coexistence of people in a community.\n\nThis seminar is intended for students with an interest in philosophy and ethics, potentially in relation to contemporary ethical and political questions. By the end of the course, students will have a deep understanding of Aristotle's ethical theory and its relevance to a critical engagement with contemporary ethical debates. \n\nNo prerequisites. Participation involves reading the ~300 pages of Aristotle\u2019s ethics over the semester in weekly portions.\n\nThis is a hybrid class: Students can participate on site or remotely in Big Blue Button.

            "description": "Veranstaltungstrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJWBoWcLL4U\n\nDie Sexualethik ist ein Teil der philosophischen Ethik, in der normative Fragen \u2014 also Fragen nach der moralischen Angemessenheit von z.B. menschlichen Verhalten \u2014 auf den Bereich der Sexualit\u00e4t angewendet werden. Sexualit\u00e4t umfasst jedwede Art der sexuellen Handlung, aber auch Fragen nach der sexuellen Pr\u00e4ferenz, sexueller Lust und der sexuellen Identit\u00e4t. Viel der moralphilosophischen Auseinandersetzung mit Sexualit\u00e4t hat mit dem Wunsch nach Reglementierung und Einschr\u00e4nkung eben dieser zu tun. Andererseits geht es aber auch darum, inwiefern Sexualit\u00e4t zu einem guten und erf\u00fcllten Leben beitr\u00e4gt, und welche besonderen Regeln dabei im Umgang mit anderen Menschen gelten. In diesem Seminar besprechen wir gemeinsam einige Theorien der Sexualethik durch die Philosophiegeschichte hinweg. Interessant ist hier beispielsweise bereits im antiken Griechenland die sogenannte \"P\u00e4derastie\", die eine institutionalisierte Form der Homosexualit\u00e4t unter M\u00e4nnern darstellte. Sp\u00e4ter, im Mittelalter, finden wir vor allem von Sexualpessimismus gepr\u00e4gte Theorien, also Theorien die mit Sexualit\u00e4t und deren Auslebung vor allem negative Auswirkungen und notwendige Einschr\u00e4nkung verbanden, so z.B. in Augustinus fr\u00fchchristlicher Sexualmoral. Marquis de Sade lehnte im 18. Jahrhundert dann jegliche Sexualmoral ab, was wir uns durch die Linse von Simone de Beauvoirs Kritik im 20. Jahrhundert anschauen wollen. Und kurz nach den einflussreichen psychoanalytischen Ans\u00e4tzen des 20. Jahrhunderts kommen auch die ersten dezidiert feministischen Ans\u00e4tze in der Sexualethik auf, die die bis dahin geltenden Anspr\u00fcche an den Pranger stellen und kritisieren, wobei wir uns dann mit aktuelleren feministischen Positionen auseinandersetzen werden, u.U. Gayle Rubin oder Fiona Woolard. \nDie Thematik der Sexualethik ist auch vor dem Hintergrund aktueller politischer Debatten interessant, so z.B. vor der Einschr\u00e4nkung der Abtreibungsrechte u.a. in den USA, die gesetzlichen Verbote \u00fcber queere Sexualit\u00e4t aufzukl\u00e4ren, wie wir sie in Ungarn und Polen finden, und die deutsche Debatte um Selbstbestimmungsgesetz und die gesetzliche Anerkennung eines Aufbruchs der Geschlechterbinarit\u00e4t.\nDas Seminar inklusive aller Diskussionen findet auf Deutsch statt. Einige der zu lesenden Texte sind auf Englisch verfasst. Alle f\u00fcr das Seminar erforderlichen Texte werden auf stud.ip hochgeladen. ",

            "soup_description": "Event trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJWBoWcLL4U Sexual ethics is a part of philosophical ethics in which normative questions \u2014 i.e. questions about the moral adequacy of, for example, human behavior \u2014 are applied to the realm of sexuality. Sexuality includes any type of sexual action, but also questions about sexual preference, sexual lust, and sexual identity. Much of the moral philosophical examination of sexuality has to do with the desire to regulate and restrict it. On the other hand, however, it is also about the extent to which sexuality contributes to a good and fulfilled life, and what special rules apply in dealing with other people. In this seminar we discuss together some theories of sexual ethics through the history of philosophy. In ancient Greece, for example, the so-called \"paederastia\", which represented an institutionalized form of homosexuality among men, is already interesting. Later, in the Middle Ages, we find above all theories characterized by sexual pessimism, i.e. theories that combined mainly negative effects and necessary limitations with sexuality and its development, e.g. in Augustine of early Christian sexual morality. Marquis de Sade then rejected all sexual morality in the 18th century, which we want to look at through the lens of Simone de Beauvoir's criticism in the 20th century. And shortly after the influential psychoanalytic approaches of the 20th century. In the early 20th century, the first determined feminist approaches in sexual ethics are also emerging, which set out and criticize the hitherto valid claims to the pillory, whereby we will then deal with more current feminist positions, such as Gayle Rubin or Fiona Woolard. The topic of sexual ethics is also interesting against the background of current political debates, e.g. before the restriction of abortion rights in the USA, among others, to clarify the legal prohibitions on queer sexuality as we find them in Hungary and Poland, and the German debate on self-determination law and the legal recognition of a departure of gender binaryity. The seminar, including all discussions, takes place in German. Some of the texts to be read are written in English. All texts required for the seminar will be uploaded to stud.ip. .",

Manufacturing tools and using them is driven by and has driven mental representations that are hierarchical and often recursive.\nMany animals use tools, e.g., chimpanzees use twigs to fish for ants or rooks can bend wire into a hook shape to retrieve objects. We will look at tool innovation, manufacture, and use in apes, mammals, and big-brained birds.\nTool-related behaviors engage particular areas in the brain in humans, among them the left-inferior parietal cortex, presumably for storing manipulation knowledge and/or reasoning about physical object properties.

            "soup": "Title: Study Project: Emergent behaviors in a multi-agent system with reinforcement learning (Part III). Description: In this study project, the group will work together to further develop a multi-agent system. The multi-agent system simulates a microcosm of simple artificial organisms (agents) in a puzzle-foraging scenario, trained with reinforcement learning. We make use of DeepMind\u2019s MuJoCo physics engine to investigate emergent properties and dynamics between populations of agents, e.g. language, cooperation, and strategies.\n\nNote: This course can be attended by students starting new with their 1st part of a 2-semester study project in SS23, and students continuing their study project course from the previous semester. There is also a separate 1-semester interdisciplinary seminar accompanying the study project. Due to the high demand for last semester\u2019s study project with the same topic, new students will be given the chance to join the current project group with the same topic for another two semesters. Prerequisites are competence in programming and either basic experience with simulation frameworks such as Unity or MuJoCo or basic knowledge of Machine Learning / RL. However, please note that due to the high demand, only a limited amount of new students can be admitted.\n\nWe have received a high volume of interest in this project and to that end, we are compelled to conduct a selection process to provide a meaningful organization and supervision for all participants. As part of the selection process, we will be requesting applicants to submit a brief essay that introduces themselves and their motivation for participating in the project. This will help us to better understand each candidate and determine the best fit for the program. More information on that will be announced around two weeks before the course starts. While I cannot guarantee your acceptance into the study project at this time, I encourage you to apply with regard to the course prerequisites. . Status: Study Project. Mode: in person. ECTS: 12.

The aim of the lecture is to get the students familiar with the concept of modelling and abstracting data, and the up to date knowledge about computational processes in the brain. After a short introduction that covers probability theory, and linear models for regression and classification, we will start a journey through the fields of graphical models and liquid computing. In the last part of the lecture we will conclude with an outlook to self-organization with the purpose to optimize information processing in complex systems like the brain.

In 1913, he left his position at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt and became the director of the Prussian Academy of Sciences Anthropoid Research Station on the island of Tenerife, Canary Islands. He worked there for six years, during which he wrote his pioneering book \u201cThe Mentality of Apes\u201d (1917), focusing on the cognitive aspect of problem solving. K\u00f6hler carried out behavioural experiments with four chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), Chica, Grande, Konsul, and Sultan, involving for instance retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He showed that the chimpanzees stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders, to retrieve the food, or if the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms. K\u00f6hler concluded that these results provided evidence for \u2018insight\u2019 and planning in chimpanzees. He thereby challenged the hypothesis of Edward Thorndike (American psychologist), who had claimed that trial-and-error learning is the basis of all animal learning.\n\nK\u00f6hlers\u2019 research showed that the intellectual gap between humans and chimpanzees was much narrower than previously thought and was revolutionary when originally published in 1917 in German. However, it was largely ignored for decades because it violated the traditional view that animal behavior and cognition is simply the result of instinct or conditioning.\nIn the first part of the study project \u2018The mentality of apes by Wolfgang K\u00f6hler: One century later\u2019 (WS 2022/2023, SS 2023), we will re-read the original book and re-evaluate the findings and its influence on studies of animal \u2018insight\u2019, \u2018tool-use\u2019 and \u2018future planning\u2019.
